Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides developers with a set of tools to build, deploy, and scale modern applications quickly.  
It offers features like a hosted PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, authentication, storage, and auto-generated APIs â€” all with an easy-to-use interface.

With Supabase, you can focus on building your application logic without worrying about server management or complex infrastructure.  
It is fully open-source, developer-friendly, and designed to be an alternative to Firebase, but powered by SQL.

This documentation will guide you through installing, configuring, and using Supabase in your projects, providing best practices and code examples along the way.
